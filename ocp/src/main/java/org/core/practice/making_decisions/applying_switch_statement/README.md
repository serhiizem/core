The following is a list of
all data types supported by switch statements:  
■ int and Integer  
■ byte and Byte  
■ short and Short  
■ char and Character  
■ String  
■ enum values  
■ var (if the type resolves to one of the preceding types)


<br/><br/>
Next, the data type for case statements must match the data type of the switch variable.
For example, you can’t have a case statement of type String if the switch statement variable is
of type int, since the types are incomparable
