Rules to remember for legal identifiers:

* Identifiers must begin with a letter, a currency symbol, or a _ symbol. Currency symbols
include dollar ($), yuan (¥), euro (€), and so on.


* Identifiers can include numbers, but not start with them.


* A single underscore _ is not allowed as an identifier.


* You cannot use the same name as a Java reserved word.
  

* `true`, `false`, and `null` are literal
  values, so they can’t be variable names. Additionally, there are contextual keywords like
  `module`
