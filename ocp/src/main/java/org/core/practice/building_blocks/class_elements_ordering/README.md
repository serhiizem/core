Think of the acronym **PIC** (picture): package, import, and class

**Package** declaration: package abc; First line in the file (excluding comments or blank lines)

**import** statements import java.util.*; Immediately after the package (if present)

**Top-level type** declaration `public class C` Immediately after the import
